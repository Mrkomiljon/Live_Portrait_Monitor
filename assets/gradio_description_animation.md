<span style="font-size: 1.2em;">ðŸ”¥ To animate the source portrait with the driving video, please follow these steps:</span>
<div style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-left: 20px;">
1. In the <strong>Animation Options</strong> section, we recommend enabling the <strong>do crop (source)</strong> option if faces occupy a small portion of your image.

3. If you want to upload your own driving video, <strong>the best practice</strong>:

 - Crop it to a 1:1 aspect ratio (e.g., 512x512 or 256x256 pixels), or enable auto-driving by checking `do crop (driving video)`.
 - Focus on the head area, similar to the example videos.
 - Minimize shoulder movement.
 - Make sure the first frame of driving video is a frontal face with **neutral expression**.
